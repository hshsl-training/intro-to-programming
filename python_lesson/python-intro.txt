# Install Miniconda

The Miniconda installer will install python. You don't need to intall it before hand.

# Testing Student Environment

## Create Conda Environment

A conda environt will be used to install dependencies

```
conda create -n python-intro
conda activate python-intro
```

After creating the environment and enabling it, the terminal should show you a prefix with the environment name. Example:

```
(python-intro) student@intropython:~$
```

## Install dependencies

We want the students to be able to install jupyter, pandas, biopython, and seaborn packages. 

```
conda install jupyter pandas biopython seaborn
```

To verify that the packages have been installed you can use:

```
conda list
```

The packages should appear in alphabetical order. 

## Start jupyter notebook

To run a jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

It should provide you with a localhost url that you can visit, or it may pop-up automatically. 

# The data

## Files that will be needed for the course are: 

"combined_tidy_vcf.csv"
"ls_orchid.fasta"
"ls_orchid.gbk"

## To test if the data is working: 

## Working with pandas:

```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('/home/student/Documents/project_name/data/combined_tidy_vcf.csv')
df.head()
```
This commands should pull the data into a pandas dataframe and display the first rows
Pay attention to the directory path. Student should have a project_name folder and a data folder. Inside that data folder should be stored the three files mentioned above. 

## Working with Biopython: 

```
from Bio import Seq, pairwise2
seq1= "CTTTTTTT"
seq2= "CTTTTTTTT"
alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1,seq2)

for alignment in alignments:
    print(pairwise2.format_alignment(*alignment))
```
This commands should contrast two gene sequences and display the aligments in a pretty format.
