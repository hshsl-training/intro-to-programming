All text and materials in these workshops comes from the Data Carpentries. More especifically this lesson follows the Data Carpentries lesson "[Programming with Python](https://j-p-courneya.github.io/Intro-Python-Bioinformatics/)". 

CDABS has modified this lesson to better fit our techonogical capabilities.

## Tecnological Resourses to Replicate this tutorial. 
- Install [Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
- Download [Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). 
- Set up your [Virtual Machine using VirtualBox & Ubuntu Destkop](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview).
- Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/#quick-command-line-install) using the terminal in your newly created VM (remember to follow the Linux instructions).
:::

For this course we are going to be using a virtual machine that runs a Ubuntu/Linux operating system. 
In that virtual machine, we are going to deploy a jupyter notebook and learn the basics of the python syntax, learn some pandas and biopython commands.
  
## What is a Virtual Machine? 

A virtual machine simulates computer hardware by destinating a portion of your physical computer RAM, CPU and Storage to virtual device. Its like having a computer inside another computer. The software that deploys virtual machines is called a hypervisor. VirtualBox will be the hypervisor for this tutorial.

## What are the benefits of a Virtual Machine?

You can play around, break things, install multiple software, try different operating systems without harming your host machine's operating system.

For this workshop, we are using virtual machines so all participants have the same computing environment.
