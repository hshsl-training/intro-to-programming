title: Reproducible Research Enviroments with Python
code-copy: true
---

## Introduction and Class Setup

This course is designed to introduce participants to a reproducible research environment. Briefly, it attempts to provide an experience of how to interact with a Jupyter notebooks web interface where documentation and computational processes are combined in a single document. Likewise, participants will be able to interact with the Conda package manager. Conda minimizes research software installation errors by allowing the creation of virtual environments. Finally, participants will be exposed to the Python programming language by being able to practice basic commands, and will be briefly introduced to two Python packages, Pandas and BioPython.

## Tecnological Resourses to Replicate this tutorial. 
- Install [Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
- Download [Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). 
- Set up your [Virtual Machine using VirtualBox & Ubuntu Destkop](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview).
- Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/#quick-command-line-install) using the terminal in your newly created VM (remember to follow the Linux instructions).

## What is a Virtual Machine? 

A virtual machine simulates computer hardware by destinating a portion of your physical computer RAM, CPU and Storage to virtual device. Its like having a computer inside another computer. The software that deploys virtual machines is called a hypervisor. VirtualBox will be the hypervisor for this tutorial.

## What are the benefits of a Virtual Machine?

You can play around, break things, install multiple software, try different operating systems without harming your host machine's operating system.

For this workshop, we are using virtual machines so all participants have the same computing environment.
